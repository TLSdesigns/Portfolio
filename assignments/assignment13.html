          You are free to combine your favorite blazer with pants, shorts, skirts, dresses and jeans.
          This magic piece will instantly change your casual outfit and make it look more smart-casual.
          All in all, a blazer is clothing staple that every woman must-have.
          It ideally works for daily combos, as well as for night-outs on the town.
          Believe me, you can never have enough blazers in your closet.
          A fitted, classically cut, double-breasted navy blue blazer with navy-style buttons is a popular design and sometimes referred to as a "reefer" blazer.
          Particularly in North America and the United Kingdom, it is now frequently used in business casual attire.

          Look professional and put-together with your blazer paired with a crisp white shirt, tailored pants, and black or nude pumps.
          Dainty jewelry can also add a personal touch without going overboard.
          Trade your pumps for loafers! To transition your outfit from business professional to business casual, add a cute and comfy sweater over a crisp dress shirt.
          Blazers, in a wide range of colours, are worn as part of school uniforms by many schools across the Commonwealth, and are still daily wear for most uniformed pupils in Britain, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.
          These are blazers in the traditional sense: single-breasted, and often of bright colours or with piping.
